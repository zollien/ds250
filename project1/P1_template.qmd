## Project Notes

__For Project 1 the answer to each question should include a chart **and** a written response. The years labels on your charts should not include a comma. At least **two** of your charts must include reference marks.__  

```{python}
# Learn morea about Code Cells: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html

# Include and execute your code here
df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv") #connects to data source (, index_col=0) added.


names = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv") 
names #shows cvs datasource x393384 rows x 54 columns
```

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?__

_Historically Zoe had limited use in the early 1900s as it was rarely used between 1910 and 1978, which is my birth year. The trend for the name Zoe did not begin until the late 1980s with a sharp and steady increase. Use of the name Zoe from 1990 onward shows an increase that demonstrates the name has increased in popularity a thousand fold._


```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

df_Zoe = df[df["name"] == "Zoe"] #checks for Zoe in data set (104 rows)
(
  ggplot(data=df_Zoe, mapping=aes(x="year", y="Total")) 
  + geom_line() 
  + labs(
    title="Zoe name distribution from 1910 to 2015",
    subtitle="Total Zoe names recorded by year",
    x="Year",
    y="Total",
  )
  + scale_x_continuous(format = "d")
  + geom_vline(xintercept=1978, color="green", linetype="solid")
  + geom_text(x=1978, y=max(df_Zoe["Total"]), label="Birth Year")
)

 



```



## QUESTION|TASK 2

__If you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of his or her age? What ages would you not guess?__

_If I spoke to Brittany on the telephone, the age that I would guess for them is 35 years old; she or he  would not be 55 or 15 as the data identifies._

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

df_Brittany = df[df["name"] == "Brittany"] #checks for Brittany in data set (104 rows)
(
  ggplot(data=df_Brittany, mapping=aes(x="year", y="Total")) 
  + geom_line() 
  + labs(
    title="Brittany name distribution from 1910 to 2015",
    subtitle="Total Brittany names recorded by year",
    x="Year",
    y="Total",
  )
  + scale_x_continuous(format = "d")
  + geom_vline(xintercept=1990, color="green", linetype="solid")
  + geom_text(x=1990, y=max(df_Brittany["Total"]), label="Expected Age of Brittany...", size=5)
  + geom_vline(xintercept=1970, color="green", linetype="solid")
  + geom_text(x=1970, y=max(df_Brittany["Total"]), label="Not Expected Age of Brittany...", size=5)
  + geom_vline(xintercept=2010, color="green", linetype="solid")
  + geom_text(x=2010, y=max(df_Brittany["Total"]), label="Not Expected Age of Brittany...", size=5)
)
```


## QUESTION|TASK 3

__Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul are all Christian names. From 1920 - 2000, compare the name usage of each of the four names in a single chart. What trends do you notice?__

_Use of the name Mary was significantly higher than the combine use of Martha, Paul and Peter until the mid 1950â€™s when all four names began to decline in popularity. As Mary was the most popular, this name decreased at a greater rate than the others until the mid 1970s. From then all four name have had a steady decline as other more creative and international names were introduced instead of standard Christian or biblical names._

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

df_Christian_names = df[df["name"].isin(["Mary", "Martha", "Peter", "Paul"])]
(
  ggplot(data=df_Christian_names, mapping=aes(x="year", y="Total", color="name")) 
  + geom_line() 
  + labs(
    title="Mary, Martha, Peter and Paul name distribution from 1920 to 2000",
    subtitle="Total names recorded by year",
    x="Year",
    y="Total",
  )
  + scale_x_continuous(format = "d")

)
```


## QUESTION|TASK 4

__Think of a unique name from a famous movie. Plot the usage of that name and see how changes line up with the movie release. Does it look like the movie had an effect on usage?__  

_The movie Rocky had no real impact on the use of the name Rocky. The film was released in 1976 at which point the name was already in a steady rapid increase. As the name began a second steady decline withing four years of the movie, we can see that there was no lasting impact from the movie on the choice of the name Rocky._

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here
df_Rocky = df[df["name"] == "Rocky"] #checks for Rocky in data set (? rows)
(
  ggplot(data=df_Rocky, mapping=aes(x="year", y="Total")) 
  + geom_line() 
  + labs(
    title="Rocky name distribution from 1976",
    subtitle="Total Rocky names recorded by year",
    x="Year",
    y="Total",
  )
  + scale_x_continuous(format = "d")
  + geom_vline(xintercept=1976, color="green", linetype="solid")
  + geom_text(x=1976, y=max(df_Rocky["Total"]), label="Movie Year Release of Rocky...", size=5)

)

```

## STRETCH QUESTION|TASK 1

__Reproduce the chart Elliot using the data from the `names_year.csv` file.__ 

_This chart is a representation of the chart provided. The axes have not been scaled to match, background colour needs changing and reference annotations need to be repositioned._

```{python}

# Include and execute your code here

df_Elliot = df[df["name"] == "Elliot"] #checks for Elliot in data set 
(
  ggplot(data=df_Elliot, mapping=aes(x="year", y="Total")) 
  + geom_line(color = "blue") #assigns a color blue to line
  + labs(
    title="Elliot... What?",
    subtitle="",
    x="Year",
    y="Total",
  )
  + scale_x_continuous(format = "d")

  + geom_vline(xintercept=1983, color="red", linetype="dashed")
  + geom_text(x=1983, y=max(df_Elliot["Total"]), label="E.T Released", size=5)

  + geom_vline(xintercept=1985, color="red", linetype="dashed")
  + geom_text(x=1985, y=max(df_Elliot["Total"]), label="Second Release", size=5)

  + geom_vline(xintercept=2003, color="red", linetype="dashed")
  + geom_text(x=2003, y=max(df_Elliot["Total"]), label="Third Release", size=5)


)
