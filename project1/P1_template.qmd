## Project Notes

__For Project 1 the answer to each question should include a chart **and** a written response. The years labels on your charts should not include a comma. At least **two** of your charts must include reference marks.__  

```{python}
# Learn morea about Code Cells: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html

# Include and execute your code here
df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv") #connects to data source (, index_col=0) added.


names = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv") 
names #shows cvs datasource x393384 rows x 54 columns
```

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?__

_Historically Zoe had limited use in teh the early 1900s..._


```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

df_Zoe = df[df["name"] == "Zoe"] #checks for Zoe in data set (104 rows)
(
  ggplot(data=df_Zoe, mapping=aes(x="year", y="Total")) 
  + geom_line() 
  + labs(
    title="Zoe name distribution from 1910 to 2015",
    subtitle="Total Zoe names recorded by year",
    x="Year",
    y="Total",
  )
  + scale_x_continuous(format = "d")
  + geom_vline(xintercept=1978, color="green", linetype="solid")
  + geom_text(x=1978, y=max(df_Zoe["Total"]), label="Birth Year")
)

 



```



## QUESTION|TASK 2

__If you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of his or her age? What ages would you not guess?__
